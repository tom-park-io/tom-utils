      "comment": "1) This article discusses the Federal Reserve's monetary policy (interest rate cuts), which is a macroeconomic topic but unrelated to tariffs or trade policy. 2) There is no mention of tariffs, Trump, or international trade, making it only loosely related in the sense that both are major economic policy decisions. The similarity is low, consistent with the benchmark example."
