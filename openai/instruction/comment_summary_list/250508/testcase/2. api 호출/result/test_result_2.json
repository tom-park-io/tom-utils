      "content": "Elon Musk tweets a meme about Dogecoin, causing a 10% price spike within hours.",
      "comment": "This article is closely related to the reference article as both focus on Elon Musk's influence on Dogecoin's price. The reference article discusses Musk's announcement about Tesla accepting Dogecoin, while this article covers a meme tweet by Musk that also impacts DOGE's price. Both share the same central figure (Musk) and cryptocurrency (DOGE), but the specific event (Tesla acceptance vs. meme tweet) differs, warranting a high but not perfect similarity score."
