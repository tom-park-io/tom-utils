      "comment": "This article is closely related to the reference article as both focus on Elon Musk's influence on Dogecoin's price. The reference discusses Tesla accepting DOGE for merchandise, while this article covers a Musk tweet causing a price spike. Both involve Musk-driven DOGE surges, but the specific event (Tesla acceptance vs. meme tweet) differs, so it's not an exact match."
