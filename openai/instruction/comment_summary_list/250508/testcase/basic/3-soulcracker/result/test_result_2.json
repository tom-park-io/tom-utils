      "content": "Elon Musk tweets a meme about Dogecoin, causing a 10% price spike within hours.",
      "comment": "This article is closely related to the reference article as both focus on Elon Musk's influence on Dogecoin's price movements. The reference article discusses Musk's announcement about Tesla accepting Dogecoin, while this article covers a meme tweet by Musk that also impacts DOGE's price. Both share the same central figure (Musk), the same cryptocurrency (DOGE), and the theme of price surges triggered by Musk's actions. However, the specific event (Tesla accepting DOGE vs. Musk tweeting a meme) differs, so the score is not a perfect match."
