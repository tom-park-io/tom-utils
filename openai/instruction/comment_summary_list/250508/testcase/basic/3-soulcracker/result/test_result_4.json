      "content": "Elon Musk tweets a meme about Dogecoin, causing a 10% price spike within hours.",
      "comment": "1. Both articles focus on Elon Musk's influence on Dogecoin's price, with Musk's actions (announcement vs. meme tweet) directly causing a surge in DOGE value. 2. The event type is similar—Musk-driven news impacting Dogecoin's market—but the reference article is about Tesla accepting DOGE for merchandise, while this is about a meme tweet. Thus, they share the same theme and actor but differ in the specific event."
