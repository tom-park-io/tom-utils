      "content": "Elon Musk tweets a meme about Dogecoin, causing a 10% price spike within hours.",
      "comment": "This article is closely related to the reference article as both focus on Elon Musk's influence on Dogecoin's price movements. The reference article discusses Musk's announcement about Tesla accepting Dogecoin, while this article covers a meme tweet by Musk that also impacts DOGE's price. Both involve Musk and DOGE price surges, but the specific events differ (merchandise acceptance vs. meme tweet), so the score is high but not a perfect match."

There is no overlap in key figures, companies, or event type, so the similarity is minimal."
