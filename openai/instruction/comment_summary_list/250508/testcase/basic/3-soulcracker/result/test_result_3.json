      "comment": "Both articles focus on Elon Musk's influence on Dogecoin's price, with the reference article about Tesla accepting DOGE and this one about a Musk tweet causing a price spike. The core similarity is Musk's impact on DOGE's value, but the specific event (Tesla's acceptance vs. a meme tweet) differs, so it's the same topic but a different event."
